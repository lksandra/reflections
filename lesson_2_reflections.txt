What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
1. git init: is the command that creates a git repo. it creates a .git [dot implies hidden file] file whose function is to import/export metadata 
    from/to ithub to/from PC.
2. git status gives the list of files that has been changed since the last commit. git doesnt make any commits by itself, even during git init.
    each commit is like a snapshot of all the files in that repo [ or specific files which we want to sync]

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
1. working directory: i think it is the local directory/clone.
2. staging area: its an intermediate stage between uncommited changes in working directory and committed changes in repository(remote)
    git add filename: adds the file to the staging area. git reset filename: this removes that filename from the staging area. this helps avoiding commits by mistake.
    git status shows files in all three states. working directory, staged, committed.
